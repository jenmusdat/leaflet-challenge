# leaflet-challenge

For this task we were asked to go to the USGS website and bring to a map recent earthquakes. I chose to use earthquakes within the last 7 days.

## Step 1

This tasked presented the challenge to bring in the earthquake to a map and add a legend. The results was:

![Map Step 1]("Leaflet-Step-1\Images\Map_Step_1.jpg")

## Step 2

This asked us to take the assignment a couple of steps further.

- Add base maps
- Plot a second dataset which was the tectonic plates. This came from a JSON that needed to be read in.
- Add Layer Controls

This resulted in some of the following maps:
![Map Step 1]("Leaflet-Step-2\Images\Landing_step_2.jpg")
![Map Step 1]("Leaflet-Step-2\Images\Light_step_2.jpg")
![Map Step 1]("Leaflet-Step-2\Images\Street_tect_step_2.jpg")

To run the map in my local server I ran a command line that said "python -m http.server"
I then opened a browser and went to "http://localhost:8000/"
I had to do this in each respective folder for wach of the graphs. One for Leaflet Step 1 and one for Leaflet Step 2.
